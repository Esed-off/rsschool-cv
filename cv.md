My goal is to get a job in IT.  
I am ready to work hard and learn a lot, I consider this my strength.

Learning C++ at my university(BSUIR), 1-st course.
Now spend a lot of time for learning HTML/CSS/JS for front-end developing.
 
I have no experience in IT sphere.

dont pass any exam for understanding of my Eanglish, in my opinion it's
something like B1-B2 level
